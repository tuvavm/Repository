    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[I would advise a potential client who is looking to secure their website from web security attacks to do the following: use a known third-party application to secure the authorisation and authentication. Make sure it is an application that is getting used a lot. I would also hire a network engineer to be responsible for the network security. And to secure the user of their website I would have an automatic user timeout, to secure their data and their website. ]</p>
